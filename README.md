## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyret/todoonamap.git
cd todoonamap
```

## Configuration

The application uses two external services:

1. MapTiler for satellite imagery
2. Supabase for data storage

The configuration is stored in `js/config.js`. Make sure to update it with your own API keys if you're forking the project.

## Database Schema

The application uses two main tables in Supabase:

### Locations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    coordinates NUMERIC[] NOT NULL,
    maintenance_info JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    location_id BIGINT REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    date_added TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
